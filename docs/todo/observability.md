  - [ ] Log HTTP requests and responses
  - [ ] Log API endpoint access
  - [ ] Log authentication attempts
  - [ ] Log rate limit hits

- [ ] Error Logging
  - [ ] Add structured error types
  - [ ] Log application errors
  - [ ] Log validation failures
  - [ ] Log security events

## Metrics Collection
### System Metrics
- [ ] Performance Monitoring

  - [ ] Monitor database connections

### Business Metrics
- [ ] Email Service Metrics
  - [ ] Track success/failure rates
  - [ ] Measure response times
  - [ ] Monitor rate limit usage
  - [ ] Track bounce rates

- [ ] API Metrics
  - [ ] Track endpoint usage
  - [ ] Monitor error rates
  - [ ] Track authentication success/failure
  - [ ] Monitor rate limiting

### Middleware Metrics
- [ ] Middleware Performance Monitoring
