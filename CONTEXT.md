Based on the provided code and documentation, here's my understanding of the project context:

1. **Project Type**: This appears to be a Go backend service, likely for an email campaign management system.

2. **Core Features**:
   - Campaign management (CRUD operations)
   - Email service with multiple providers (SMTP, Mailgun)
   - User authentication and management
   - Configuration management with environment variables

3. **Key Components**:
   - Configuration system with priority loading:

```3:7:docs/todo/configuration.md
## Priority System
### Configuration Layers
1. Environment variables (highest)
2. .env file
3. Default values (lowest)
```


   - Database integration with GORM:

```4:12:docs/todo/database.md
### Current Implementation
- [x] Connection Setup (Implemented in database/database.go)
  - [x] Implement retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - [x] Handle connection timeouts (via GORM)
  - [x] Implement connection pooling (via GORM)
  - [x] Add connection health checks (via GORM)
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Add connection metrics collection
- [x] Implement connection event logging (via LoggingDBDecorator)
```


   - Email service with multiple providers:

```26:37:docs/todo/email.md
### Mailgun Provider
- [x] Basic Integration
  - [x] Test API interaction
  - [x] Test error handling
  - [ ] Test rate limiting
  - [ ] Test webhook handling
  - [ ] Test webhook handling
### Mailpit Provider (Development)
- [x] Basic Integration
  - [x] Test local sending
  - [x] Test SMTP interaction
  - [ ] Test debugging features
```


4. **Architecture Patterns**:
   - Using dependency injection
   - Decorator pattern for email service
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - Service layer architecture

5. **Testing Approach**:
   - Using testify for assertions
   - Separate test packages (`package config_test`)
   - Focus on unit and integration testing
   - Performance testing requirements

6. **Security Considerations**:

```10:15:docs/todo/security.md
### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Session Security
  - [ ] Add session encryption
  - [ ] Add session security headers
  - [ ] Implement secure cookie handling
  - [ ] Add CSRF protection
```


7. **Deployment Strategy**:

```3:9:docs/todo/deployment.md
## Phase 1: Docker Setup
### Container Configuration
- [ ] Create production Dockerfile
- [x] Setup docker-compose for local development (using devcontainer)
- [ ] Setup docker-compose for production
- [ ] Configure environment variables

```


8. **Configuration Management**:
   - Uses environment variables
   - .env file support
   - Required fields validation
   - Path normalization
   - Logging level management

The project appears to be in active development with many features implemented but still requiring testing coverage. The configuration package we're working on is a critical component that handles all application configuration and environment management.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the project context?
